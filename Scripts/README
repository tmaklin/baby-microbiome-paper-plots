## Scripts and batch jobs used for the baby microbiome analyses
### Files
- create_multifasta.sh: the script used to create the reference multifasta from the assemblies.
- batch-jobs/: folder containing the batch job scripts that were used to run the analyses.
               Note: the scripts do not fully reproduce the analyses as they were run several times
	       with modified inputs, but the scripts document the options used for the different programs.
- batch-jobs-inputs: example inputs used with the batch job scripts.
